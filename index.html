            <h1>AMD HISTORY</h1>
            <p>
              Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), global company that specializes
              in manufacturing semiconductor devices used in computer processing.
              The company also produces flash memories, graphics processors,
              motherboard chip sets, and a variety of components used in consumer
              electronics goods. The company is a major supplier of
              microprocessors (computer chips). AMD is based in Santa Clara,
              California. AMD was founded in 1969 by Walter Jeremiah (“Jerry”)
              Sanders, a former executive at Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation,
              and seven others. The company released its first product in 1970 and
              went public two years later. In the mid-1970s the company began
              producing computer chips. Starting out as a second-source
              manufacturer of computer chips, the company placed a great emphasis
              on quality and grew steadily. In 1982 the company began supplying
              second-source chips for Intel Corporation, which made the
              microprocessor used in IBM personal computers (PCs). The agreement
              with Intel ended in 1986. In 1991 AMD released the Am386
              microprocessor family, a reverse-engineered chip that was compatible
              with Intel’s next-generation 32-bit 386 microprocessor. There ensued
              a long legal battle that was finally decided in a 1994 U.S. Supreme
              Court ruling in AMD’s favour. That same year, Compaq Computer
              Corporation contracted with AMD to produce Intel-compatible chips
              for their computers. In 1996 AMD acquired a microprocessor company
              known as NexGen and began branching out from the Intel-compatible
              chip market. In 2000 AMD introduced the Athlon processor, which was
              designed to run the Microsoft Corporation’s Windows operating
              system. With the release of the Athlon processor, AMD became the
              first company to produce a 1-GHz (gigahertz) microprocessor, which
              marked AMD as a serious competitor in the chip market. In 2003 the
              company released the Opteron chip, another product that showcased
              the company’s ability to produce high-end chips. In 2006 AMD
              absorbed ATI Technologies, a manufacturer of video graphics cards
              for use in PCs. In 2008 AMD announced plans to split the company in
              two—with one part designing microprocessors and the other
              manufacturing them. This announcement followed news that the
              Advanced Technology Investment Company and the Mubadala Development
              Company, both based in Abu Dhabi, would acquire a controlling
              interest in AMD, pending approval by shareholders and the U.S. and
              German governments. In 2009, following a series of complaints lodged
              by AMD, the European Commission fined rival Intel a record €1.06
              billion (£948 million; $1.45 billion) for engaging in
              anticompetitive practices that violated the European Union’s
              antitrust laws. These practices allegedly involved financially
              compensating and providing rebates to manufacturers and retailers
              who favoured its computer chips over those of AMD, as well as paying
              manufacturers to cancel or postpone the launching of products
              utilizing AMD’s chips. In 2014 the company was restructured into two
              parts: computing and graphics, which made processors for personal
              computers, and enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom, which made
              more-specialized processors.

        <h1 class="seriesHeader">The first official reference to the 'AMD Ryzen 9000 series' gives Zen 5 a name and hints at an imminent release date</h1>
        <div class="newChip">
          <img src="/images/chip.jpg" alt="chip">
          <article>
            <h2>Gigabyte's latest AM5 BIOS update means it's time to say hello to the Ryzen 9000 series, as if we suspected any other name.</h2>
            <p>We've suspected AMD's Granite Ridge family of Zen 5 based processors might show their faces soon, given that AMD has already 
              said it's aiming for a launch in the second half of this year, and CEO Dr. Lisa Su is set to deliver the Computex keynote on June 3. 
              Now Gigabyte has released a BIOS update for several of its AM5 series of motherboards in anticipation of the new chips, and it seems 
              to confirm that they'll be called the AMD Ryzen 9000 series.
              In a news post on the company website, the Gigabyte AM5 X670, B650 and A620 motherboards are confirmed to receive 
              boot up support for "the coming AMD Ryzen™ 9000 series", with the most recent AGESA 1.1.7.0 beta BIOS. 
              While we've already seen leaks suggesting this name would be used for the new chips, this is the first official announcement that seems to confirm it.
              While it's far from certain that the chips will be announced at Computex in June, it seems like motherboard manufacturers are busy 
              preparing their boards for the new chips' imminent release. Intel's competing next-gen Arrow Lake chips have still yet to break cover, although 
              recent rumours have suggested that Team Blue's new CPUs may be closer to release than previously thought, with a potential release in the first half of this year.
              In terms of what to expect from Zen 5 when it comes to performance, a recent post by leaker Kepler_L2 has suggested that the new chips are over 40% faster than Zen 4 in the SPEC benchmark. 
              While performance numbers at this point are to be taken with an appropriately huge dose of salt, if that performance 
              leap turns out to be true we may be looking at some particularly fast CPUs compared to the previous generation, which weren't exactly slouches in the benchmarks to begin with.</p>

        <h1 class="rxxtHeader">AMD just announced the graphics card everyone has been waiting for</h1>
        <div class="rxxtGpu">
          <article>
            <p>AMD just launched the RX 7600 XT at CES 2024. It’s a graphics card that makes sense, and one that AMD fans have been waiting on ever since the launch of the original RX 7600. 
              It might not do enough in the hotly contested market of graphics cards around $300, however.
              Between the RX 7600 and the RX 7600 XT, not much has changed. These two graphics cards are based on the same GPU, and they come with the same number of cores. 
              The XT model, however, boosts the clock speed by up to 10%, and it comes with a higher power draw at up to 190 watts.
              The big difference is 16GB of GDDR6 memory, however. It seems AMD took a plan from Nvidia’s playbook here, bumping up the memory capacity without major changes to the other specs (much in the style of the RTX 4060 Ti). 
              The big problem here is that the memory is still squeezed across a 128-bit bus, just like on the original RX 7600.
              <br><br>
              That could become a problem. Higher memory capacity is great, but with such a thin bus width, the RX 7600 XT will likely be starved for bandwidth. 
              It’s not a dissimilar situation to what we saw with the RTX 4060 Ti, in fact, where last-gen’s RTX 3060 Ti offered better performance in some titles due to having a larger bus size, not more memory capacity.
              AMD is claiming higher performance for the RX 7600 XT over the base model, though. The biggest improvement from the data shared comes in Forza Horizon 5, where the XT model showed 
              a 40% improvement at 1080p and a 45% improvement at 1440p. Other titles show much smaller improvements, however. In Starfield and The Last of Us Part I, for example, the XT model offers closer to a 17% jump.
